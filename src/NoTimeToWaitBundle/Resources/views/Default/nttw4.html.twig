For all sessions we will have a designated onsite representative of remote participants (inspired by the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7649">Jabber scribe role defined by IETF</a>), so that if you’d like to ask a question to a speaker and request clarification from someone onsite, there will be a designated person in the room that will monitor the chatroom and support remote attendees.</p>

<h2>Travel Grants</h2>

<h2>What's the Word About No Time To Wait</h2>

<p><i>No Time to Wait 2 was a strong statement in regard to the increased and enormously productive collaboration between film and media archivists and developers. It opened up a perspective for digital film preservation pathways and practices that are based on open standards, open source software, and business models which balance openness and the avoidance of vendor lock-in with plannability and adequate financial reward for developers.</i><br/> -- Michael Loebenstein, Österreichisches Filmmuseum | Austrian Film Museum</p>

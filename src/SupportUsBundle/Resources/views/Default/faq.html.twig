    <h2>Voting points</h2>
    <div class="anchor-highlight">
        <p>
            Voting points are intended to give you a voice in decisions over priorities in the development of MediaArea tools. Each person with voting points get points that they can assign to a task. After a task has been completed, voting points given towards a task are applied. For example, if a person has 10 points and assigns 2 points to a task, then those points are used only when the task is complete and a person has 8 points remaining. MediaArea will then check which task has the better ratio between points and the cost of a task, and select the next task to work on.<br>
            Voting points manager will be available at the beginning of 2018.

    <h2>How useful is a single membership (without voting points)?</h2>
    <p class="anchor-highlight">
        At the moment, a single membership is a way to show your support and improve MediaArea tools. In the future, contingent on voting, you will get access to more members-only features.

    <h2>Severity levels</h2>
    <p class="anchor-highlight">
        <b>Critical</b>: production server is blocked and no workaround is immediately available. Substantial portion of critical data is at a significant risk of loss or corruption. Business operations are severely disrupted. Example: a new incoming file makes the server crashing.<br/>
        <b>Major</b>: operations can continue in a restricted mode, although productivity is adversely affected. A temporary workaround is available. Example: a format feature is expected to be detected but is not, a file is considered not compliant but is actually compliant<br/>
        <b>Minor</b>: non-critical loss of functionality. Example: text typo

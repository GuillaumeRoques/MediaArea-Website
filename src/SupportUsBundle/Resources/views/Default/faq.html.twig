    <h2>Voting points</h2>
    <div class="anchor-highlight">
        <p>
            Voting points are intended to give a voice in the decisions about priorities in the development of MediaArea tools. Each person with voting points get points that they can assign to an item. After an item is finished, MediaArea will check which item as the better ratio between points and the cost of an item, and select the next item. After an item is complete, voting points of a person are reduced by the points assigned to this item.<br>
            Voting points manager will be available begin of 2018.

    <h2>How useful is a single membership (without voting points)?</h2>
    <p class="anchor-highlight">
        At the moment, a single membership is a way to show your support and improve MediaArea tools. In the future, contingent on voting, you will get access to more members-only features.

<section id="cost" class="anchor">
    <h2>But it's expensive!</h2>
    <p class="anchor-highlight">
        MediaArea budget: 250 k€/year<br/>
        Staff : FR 170 k€/year (3 full-time), US 40 k€/year (partial time)<br/>
        Hardware/Hosting (including test files backup) : 20 k€/year<br/>
        Travel/Meetings : 10 k€/year<br/>
        Legal/Administrative : 5 k€/year<br/>
        Bank fees : 5 k€/year<br/>
        Is it expensive? lets <a href="https://letsencrypt.org//2016/09/20/what-it-costs-to-run-lets-encrypt.html" target="_blank">check an example</a>:<br/>
        200 k$ for a single person; with a similar budget we are 3-4 people working on MediaArea tools. (OK, not the same skills... But still a way to compare)

    <h2>Severity levels</h2>
    <p class="anchor-highlight">
        <b>Critical</b>: production server is blocked and no workaround is immediately available. Substantial portion of critical data is at a significant risk of loss or corruption. Business operations are severely disrupted. Example: a new incoming file makes the server crashing.<br/>
        <b>Major</b>: operations can continue in a restricted mode, although productivity is adversely affected. A temporary workaround is available. Example: a format feature is expected to be detected but is not, a file is considered not compliant but is actually compliant<br/>
        <b>Minor</b>: non-critical loss of functionality. Example: text typo

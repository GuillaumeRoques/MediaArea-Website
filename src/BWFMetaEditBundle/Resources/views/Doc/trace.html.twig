<h2>Trace</h2>
The Trace help is useful to visually inspect the composition of the RIFF structure of an audio file.<br/><br/>
The Trace view lists each file currently open in BWF MetaEdit along with a presentation of each chunk the files contains. Each row lists each chunk of the file. The first column presents the offset of each chunk as a hexadecimal value. The second column lists the declared chunk size as a hexadecimal value. The third column lists the chunk identifier. Nested chunks, such as subchunks of RIFF and LIST, are visually nested with indentation.

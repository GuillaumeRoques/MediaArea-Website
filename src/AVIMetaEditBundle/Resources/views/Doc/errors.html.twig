<tr><td>no RIFF header</td><td>The file does not initiate with a RIFF chunk.</td></tr>
<tr><td>truncated</td><td>The actual file size is less than is stated in the file's chunk size declarations. This could indicate that the file is the result of an interrupted duplication or transfer.</td></tr>
<tr><td>chunk is too big, it can not be loaded</td><td>The total size of the non-video-data chunks exceed the amount of memory available.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2 XXXX chunks</td><td>The file contains two chunks of the same chunk id but such chunk is not expected to be present twice (e.g. header).</td></tr>
